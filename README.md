# Personal-PC-Build-Project
## Overview
This project documents a personal computer I built to gain hands-on experience with hardware selection, assembly, and performance optimization.

## Objectives
- Assemble a fully functional PC from individual components
- Optimize system and hardware performance
- Troubleshoot and resolve hardware or software issues

## Components
CPU- Ryzen 7 7800x3D
RAM- 32Gb DDR5 6000MHz (2x16Gbs)
Motherboard- Gigabyte B650 Aero G
GPU- Ryzen 7900 XTX 24GB
Storage- 1TB NVMe SSD, 1TB NVMe SSD
PSU- Cooler Master 850W Gold
AIO- Thermaltake TH360 V2
Case- HYTE Y40

## Assembly and Configuration
- Installed all components into the case, connected power, front panel connectors and fan cables
- Configured BIOS settings for optimal performance (XMP on RAM, configuring fan speeds for optimal cooling)
- Installed Windows 11 Pro

## Troubleshooting
During this build I tested the most optimal fan placement for the best cooling to my components. One issue i faced is trying to install the AIO into my pc. Did some research online to figure out there was mount on the top of the case that i could put the radiator on which solved my issue.

## Skills Practiced
- PC Assembly & Hardware Troubleshooting
- BIOS Configuration
- System Performance Optimization
- Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
